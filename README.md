# DeeperCount: implementation of UNet in Keras with image deformation and complex image augmentation.

Users can use DeeperCount and their labeled images to easily train a UNet.

--------------
## System requirements

The code of DeeperCount runs under Linux (i.e., Centos, https://www.centos.org/) on a 64-bit machine with at least two GPUs. It requires Python 2.7, PERL v5, [pip](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) and several python packages listed in [python.package.requirement.txt](https://github.com/zhoujj2013/lncfuntk/blob/master/python.package.requirement.txt).;

We provide utility (INSTALL.pl) to install these packages automatically with a single command. If you want to install them manually, please download get-pip.py from https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py and install pip module with [instructions](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

LncFunTK have been tested in CentOS release 6.2, Debian 7.0 3.2.60-1+deb7u3 and ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Linux OS 64 bit).

## Installation

### Get lncFunTK
```
git clone https://github.com/zhoujj2013/lncfuntk.git --depth 1

or

wget http://sunlab.cpy.cuhk.edu.hk/lncfuntk/lncfuntk-master.zip
unzip lncfuntk-master.zip
```

### Installation

We recommend run lncFunTK under an isolated python environment, you should first make a python virtual environment by [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) as follows:

```
cd ./lncfuntk

# clean PYTHONPATH
export PYTHONPATH=

# Create an isolated python environment
virtualenv --no-site-packages env

# Activate the isolated python environment
source env/bin/activate
```

To install lncFunTK, run command as follows:

```
cd ./lncfuntk
perl INSTALL.pl --install
# installation finished.
```

The required packages will be automatically installed and supporting dataset for mm9 will be automatical downloaded by default. 

If you want to download supporting dataset in other genome version (mm10, hg19, hg38), you can run:

```
cd ./lncfuntk
perl INSTALL.pl --db hg19
```

### Run demo

If you have installed the lncFunTK package and obtained the supporting dataset, you can run demo to examine whether the package works well (the test dataset is placed in ./demo directory within lncFunTK).

```
cd demo
# create makefile
perl ../run_lncfuntk.pl config.txt
# then make the file
make

# around 15 mins.
# you can check the report (index.html) in 07Report.
firefox ./07Report/index.html
```

To run lncFunTK analysis on your data, please refer to the [walkthrough example](https://github.com/zhoujj2013/lncfuntk/blob/master/walkthroughexample.md).

## lncFunTK Runtime

The running time of lncFunTK depends on the size of input datasets. For example, with RNA-seq (10 samples), TF ChIP-seq (10 samples), CLIP-seq (1 sample) as input, ~15000 genes are involved,  it takes ~3 hours to run on a computer node (Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2697A v4 @ 2.60GHz, 32G RAM).

## lncFunTK utility

### Training optimal weight values for FIS calculation

We designed Training.pl utility script for the user to obtain optimal weight values for FIS calculation by learning from a user provided training dataset (i.e., a set of func-tional lncRNAs and nonfunctional lncRNAs), if the user thinks that the default weight matrix is not suitable for their system.

You should prepared 3 files for training:

1. a list of functional lncRNAs as positive dataset;
2. a list of nonfunctional lncRNAs (FPKM > 0.05) as negative dataset;
3. Neighbor counts for each lncRNA within the integrative regulatory network;

Then, train the optimal parameters for lncFunNet as follow:

```
cd $lncFunTK_install_dir/demo/training/
perl $lncFunTK_install_dir/bin/Training/Training.pl XXXX.Neighbor.stat postive.lst negative.lst

# result files:
# LR.weight.value.lst
# LR.png
```

LR.result file contains the optimal weight values for FIS calculation. You can use the newly trained optimal weight values for lncFunTK analysis by replacing the pretrained weight value configure file (bin/Training/pretrained.weight.value.lst).
